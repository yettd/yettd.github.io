              Brown rice has a low glycemic index (GI), meaning it doesn’t cause your blood sugar to spike after you eat. Studies show that by eating three servings per day of whole grains like brown rice, you can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 32%.

              White rice provides 14.9 mg of magnesium, which can help you reach the 420 mg recommended daily.1 Magnesium is the structural component of bones that assists in hundreds of enzyme reactions involved in synthesizing DNA and proteins and is required for proper nerve conduction and muscle contraction.

              Rice contains higher levels of resistant starch when it is cooked and cooled.3 Studies have suggested that resistant starch can form specific fatty acids that help the colon stay healthy. These fatty acids may also decrease the risk of colorectal cancer.4</p>
